Group Project 4:

	Proposal: Using the Wine dataset from the UC Irving Machine Learning Repository, we propose to use machine learning to categorize the dataset into the 3\ different cultivars.\ At this point, we are not planning in creating a separate website. \We do plan to use pandas and matplotlib to complete the requirements. \We also plan to devlop this as the project develops.
